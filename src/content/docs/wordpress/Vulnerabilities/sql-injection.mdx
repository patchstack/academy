## Introduction

This article covers cases of possible SQLi on WordPress. This includes improper usage of functions and user input handling inside of the plugin/theme which can be used to inject a malicious query into the SQL execution to leak sensitive data.

## Useful Functions

Several functions could be useful to identify a possible SQLi vulnerability:

- [`$wpdb->query`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/query/)
- [`$wpdb->get_var`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/get_var/)
- [`$wpdb->get_row`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/get_row/)
- [`$wpdb->get_col`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/get_col/)
- [`$wpdb->get_results`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/get_results/)

## Example Cases

Below is an example of vulnerable code:

```php
add_action("wp_ajax_nopriv_load_questions", "load_questions");

function load_questions(){
    global $wpdb;

    $quiz_id = $_GET["quiz_id"];

    if ( isset($_COOKIE[ 'question_ids_'.$quiz_id ]) ) {
        $question_sql = sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_COOKIE[ 'question_ids_'.$quiz_id ] ) );
    }else {
        $question_ids = array("1","2","3");
        $question_sql = implode( ',', $question_ids );
    }
    
    $order_by_sql = 'ORDER BY FIELD(question_id,'.$question_sql.')';

    $query     = $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}custom_questions WHERE question_id IN (%1s)", $question_sql);
    $questions = $wpdb->get_results( stripslashes( $query ) );

    wp_send_json($questions);
}
```

The vulnerable variable, in this case, is the `$question_sql` variable where the value is passed from `$_COOKIE[ 'question_ids_'.$quiz_id ]` value without proper sanitization or escaping. The `sanitize_text_field` function is not enough to prevent SQL Injection since the `$question_sql` variable is constructed inside an ORDER BY clause without proper escaping.

To exploit this, any unauthenticated user just needs to perform a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint specifying the needed action and parameter to trigger the SQL Injection (let's say that the `{$wpdb->prefix}custom_questions` table has 5 columns):

```http
GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=load_questions&quiz_id=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Cookie: question_ids_1=1%29%20and%20false%20union%20select%20database%28%29%2C%271337%27%2C%271337%27%2Cuser%28%29%2C%271337%27%20--%20-%20
Connection: close

```

## Magic Quotes

Magic Quotes is/was a feature in PHP designed to automatically escape certain characters in user input to prevent SQL injection (SQLi) attacks. Specifically, it would escape single quotes ('), double quotes ("), backslashes (\), and NULL characters by automatically adding backslashes before them. This was done to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, where an attacker might try to insert malicious SQL code into a query.

It is not the perfect solution. It is mostly incosistent, meaning that it only escapes certain characters. Depending on how the code works it might still allow for SQL injections or corrupted data in the database.

It was an optionality for PHP but it is disabled. Why we are mentioning it here if you ask, it still lives on WordPress via [wp_magic_quotes()
](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_magic_quotes/).

As mentioned on the page, it is a private function so developers doesn't need to implement it. If any code is executed inside WordPress hooks, inputs ($_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, and $_SERVER ) will go through the [add_magic_quotes()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_magic_quotes/)

```php
function add_magic_quotes( $input_array ) {
	foreach ( (array) $input_array as $k => $v ) {
		if ( is_array( $v ) ) {
			$input_array[ $k ] = add_magic_quotes( $v );
		} elseif ( is_string( $v ) ) {
			$input_array[ $k ] = addslashes( $v );
		}
	}

	return $input_array;
}
```

and gets sanitized due to [addslashes()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.addslashes.php).

So even a super simple vulnerable looking code like `select * from users where '$injection_here'` will be escaped and turn into something like `SELECT * FROM patchstack WHERE vulnerable = 'yes' AND published RLIKE '\' OR (select sleep(5))--' ) ORDER BY steps.ID DESC LIMIT 25` inside a WordPress hook and you will not be able to exploit it in almost all scenarios.

If the input is unslashed using [wp_unslash()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_unslash/) it will still be exploitable.
