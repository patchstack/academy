## Introduction

This article covers cases of possible sensitive data exposure on WordPress. This is a subset of Broken Access Control that impacts confidentiality instead of integrity. This vulnerability occurs due to the lack of a proper confidentiality check on the requested resource.

## Actions

Sensitive data can be leaked through hooks or actions when used without consideration for the user's permissions. Below is an example of vulnerable code:

```php
add_action("wp_ajax_nopriv_view_course", "view_course");

function view_course(){
    $course_id = urldecode( $_POST['course_id'] ?? '' );
    
    if ( empty( $course_id ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error( [ 'message' => 'Invalid Course ID' ] );
    }
    
    $course = get_post( $course_id );
    
    wp_send_json_success( [
        'id'      => $course->ID,
        'title'   => $course->post_title,
        'content' => $course->post_content,
        'excerpt' => $course->post_excerpt,
        'url'     => get_permalink( $course->ID ),
    ] );
};
```

To exploit this, any unauthenticated user needs to perform a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint specifying the post ID, which is not in the published state, to view any post information. This can lead to an attacker viewing draft, password-protected, and pending posts.

```bash
curl <WORDPRESS_BASE_URL>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=view_course&course_id=1337
```

## Logs

If the logs are stored by the plugin without any .htaccess or randomization of the log filename, it might cause a sensitive data leak.

Below is an example of vulnerable code:

```php
function write_sensitive_log($message) {
    $log_file = WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/debug.log'; // Predictable and publicly accessible
    file_put_contents($log_file, $message . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
}

add_action('init', function() {
    if (is_user_logged_in()) {
        $current_user = wp_get_current_user();
        $email = $current_user->user_email;
        write_sensitive_log('User email: ' . $email);
    }
});
```

To exploit this, any unauthenticated user can request the URL:

`http://<WORDPRESS_BASE_URL>/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name/debug.log`
